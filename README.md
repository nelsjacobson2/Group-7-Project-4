# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms and techniques. The dataset contains information about different features of houses, such as the number of rooms, year built, garage area, and more, along with their corresponding sale prices. The project involves data preprocessing, data exploration, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several steps, each implemented in a separate notebook cell:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the necessary libraries and import the datasets into pandas DataFrames. Perform data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Explore the dataset to gain insights into the features and the target variable (sale price). Use visualizations to understand feature distributions, correlations, and relationships.

3. **Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values:** Identify and handle missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques. Drop columns with a high percentage of missing values and fill missing values in other columns.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing features to enhance the model's predictive power. Perform feature transformations like log-transforming the target variable to reduce skewness.

5. **Model Building:** Build three machine learning models: a Scikit-learn Linear Regression model, a TensorFlow Neural Network model, and an XGBoost model. Train the models using the preprocessed data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (coefficient of determination). Measure the performance of the models on the test set.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform hyperparameter tuning on the XGBoost model to find the best combination of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance. Use GridSearchCV to perform a systematic search over a predefined hyperparameter grid.

8. **Cross-Validation Strategies:** Implement different cross-validation strategies, such as k-fold cross-validation, to get a more reliable estimate of the XGBoost model's performance and reduce overfitting.

9. **Regularization:** Implement L1 and L2 regularization techniques in the XGBoost model to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
